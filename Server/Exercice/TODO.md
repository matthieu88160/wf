# Exercice 1

In this exercice, we need to create the home-page of the TagBeSill project.

The test will need some dependencies. So you are expected to install them with composer.

Test case :

 * You must load the records from the database
 * Foreach record :
 	* The record image must be displayed into the html
 	* The record title must be displayed into the html
 	* The record description must be displayed into the html

To validate it, just cd into the exercice folder and run "php phpunit-6.5.5.phar".
