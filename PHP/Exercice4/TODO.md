# Exercise 4

To prepare some meeting, your CTO want a function returning all mondays of a month as string into an array. The function will receive at first argument a year, and at second place, a month, both as integer type.

The returning date is expected to be a string, and to follow the following format : 'Monday 1, Feb 2021'.

The function MUST be named 'getAllMondaysOfMonth'.

To validate it, just cd into the Exercice4 folder and run "php phpunit-6.5.5.phar".
