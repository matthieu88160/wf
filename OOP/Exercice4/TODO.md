# Exercice 3

To be used in further lessons, we should add the UserInterface of symfony to the Model\User class.

To do so, we need to download the package symfony/security in it's latest version. And implement this interface using the IDE autocompletion.

Create a new composer project into the folder src and install it with the needed dependency.

To validate it, just cd into the exercice folder and run "php phpunit-6.5.5.phar".
